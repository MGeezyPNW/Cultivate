                    <h3>Garden Box Build:</h3>
                    <p>Acceptable Quality -will last several years and decaying boards can be replaced and composted as needed. Cost is affordable.  Materials list:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            QTY 6: 1 x 6 x 8 cedar fencing. Have 2 of them cut in half at hardware store. SO you should be working with 4, 8 foot pieces and 4, 4 foot pieces now.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            12 pack of 18 inch wooden stakes, you won’t use them all, but peppers may need staking later. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            2 tomato cages, when appropriate height.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Wire remesh, hog panels, or garden trellis netting *if using trellis. In demo you’ll notice wire remesh. It also provides structural support.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Qty 6 (for full back trellis or as needed 3.5 if building trellis for half): 1 x2 x 6 - 8 foot. *For trellis support if necessary
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            1 lb exterior screws. Deck screws work, but I recommend screws that take a #2 phillips driver -will make life easier if you ever need to take apart or repair. #2 is a universal phillips.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Better Quality -substitute 2 x 12 x 8 foot cedar Boards for 2 of the cedar fencing pieces.  Remember that the hardware store can cut the boards for you.  A cut or two is typically free.  These could be screwed into each other as opposed to stakes, be sure to get longer screws.  
                    Box height is also adjustable.  If you want higher garden box add more boards and more soil.</p>

                    <p>Drill small pilot holes into end of cedar fencing and stakes, attach to stakes using 1 ¼ inch exterior screws. If using Trellis, attach to longer trellis support instead of stakes.  Place a vertical steak or support every two feet.  End result, a 4 foot x 8 foot box, 11 inches deep to fill with garden mix topsoil, and a 6 inch spike every 2 feet along bottom to bury and support structure.  The soil will also add support.</p>
