                    <h3>Raised Garden Box Build</h3>
                    <p>Acceptable quality -will last several years.  Any decaying boards can be replaced and composted as needed. Cost is affordable.  Materials list:</p>
                    <ul id="left-list">
                        <li>
                            QTY 6: 1 x 6 x 8 cedar fencing. Have 2 of them cut in half at hardware store. So you should be working with 4, 8 foot pieces and 4, 4 foot pieces now.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            12 pack of 18 inch wooden stakes, you won’t use them all, but peppers may need staking later. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            2 tomato cages.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Wire remesh, hog panels, or garden trellis netting *if using trellis. In box build photos you’ll notice wire remesh. It also provides structural support.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Qty 6 (for full back trellis or 3.5 if building trellis for half of box): 1 x 2 x 6 - 8 foot. *For trellis support if necessary
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            1 lb exterior screws. Deck screws work, but I recommend screws that take a #2 phillips driver -will make life easier if you ever need to take apart or repair. #2 is a universal phillips.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Build Variations</h3>
                    <p>Better quality -substitute 2 x 12 x 8 foot cedar Boards for 2 of the cedar fencing pieces.  Remember that the hardware store can cut the boards for you.  A cut or two is typically free.  These could be screwed into each other as opposed to stakes, be sure to get longer screws.  
                    Box height is also adjustable.  If you want higher garden box add more boards and more soil.</p>
                    <h3>Assembly</h3>
                    <p>Drill small pilot holes into end of cedar fencing and stakes.  Because we are working with smaller thinner boards for acceptable quality, pilot holes are essential.  Pilot holes will keep the screw and drill from cracking board ends.  Attach side boards to stakes using 1 ¼ inch exterior screws. If using trellis, attach to longer trellis support instead of stakes. A six foot trellis height works nicely, but the materials you use can dictate height: a remesh panel is 7 feet long.  Remesh can be held in place with a outset crew on either side of wire as it crosses support beam.  Place a vertical stake or support every two feet.  End result, a 4 foot x 8 foot box, 11 inches deep to fill with garden mix topsoil, and a 6 inch spike every 2 feet along bottom to bury and support structure.  The soil will also add support.</p>

                    <h3 id="beginner">Beginning Gardeners</h3>
                    <p>The beginning is a perfect place to start!  Your garden needs basic parameters: food, water, and environment.  If all parameters are acceptable, nature handles the rest. All of our plant recommendations can be easily grown, easily researched, and easily obtained.  Time and consistency will be your ally.  The advice given is a good start, find your path, and get your hands in the dirt!  Our garden philosophy is: any growth is good, gardening fosters community, and getting your hands in the dirt is its own reward.</p>
                    <h3>Placement</h3>
                    <p>Placement of your garden bed is important.  The back of the garden bed, the part that has the trellis and tallest plants should face north.  The front of the garden, the part that has the shortest plants should face south. Proper placement optimizes the attention your plants will recieve from the spring, summer, and fall sun.</p>  
                    <h3>Shade Definitions></h3>
                    <p>Here in the Pacific Northwest we also need to have a talk about "shade" gardening.  We typically have multiple types of shade.  Our shade gardening techniques assume that the garden bed recieves some filtered sun throughout part of the day, that the ground can be worked, watered, and taht the plot has reasonable airflow.  </p>
                    <h3>Soil</h3>
                    <p>Soil choice and ground preperation will likely determine your garden success.  Typically, you will constantly add compost and or plant food. Buying bags of garden soil for a project this size is inefficient.  <a href="https://yelp.com" target="blank">Yelp topsoil</a>, and you'll find much less expensive options.  We recommend a "garden mix" top soil and a compost mulch once plants are a few inches tall.  Compost adds nutrients and helps retain moisture.  You will need 1 - 1.5 yards topsoil for the space we've recommended, depending on how much volume is lost in the ground prep.  In preparing the ground space, be sure to remove all grass before adding soil; we don't want a raised lawn choking out your new plants.</p>

                    <h3 id="intermediate">Intermediate Gardeners</h3>
                    <p>Celebrate your garden wins and learn from your less successful plantings.  Do you have obstacles?  Do you have a garden buddy network?  Reach out. Build on your successes, provide that ideal growing environment, and keep trying new things. Our garden philosophy is: any growth is good, gardening fosters community, and getting your hands in the dirt is its own reward.</p>
    
                    <h3>Insects</h3>
                    <p>Insects will appear.  Remember, your garden is a place where life happens and insects and earthworms make it all work.  Spiders, bees, and ladybugs are your friends.  However, slugs, aphids, and a variety of other insects can destroy your success.  As a garden staple, I would recommend these  go-to staples all of which are great for organic gardening, pet safety, and child safety.  A one quart spray bottle filled with water and a couple drops of eco friendly dishsoap.  This will help with a variety of bugs and stave off mold and rust issues later in the season.  Spray once a week or as needed.  <a href="http://growslugfree.com/" target="blank">Sluggo</a> slug and snail bait kills only slugs and snails of a certain size, however it effectively protects your garden if placed every week during the spring and as needed during dryer months.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neem_oil" target="blank" >Neem oil</a> applied to a patch of aphids will resolve the issue.  Apply daily if need arises.  Keep a close eye.  A few aphids can turn into hundreds in a day or two.  They love certain plants, and can quickly destroy or forever stunt their growth.</p>
                    <h3>Plant Food</h3>
                    <p>Plant food can be a complex and expensive consideration.  Many great options exist.  An Eco-friendly but universal product is always recommended.  A stop at a trusted nursery is worth your time.  Be sure to ask if it is bee friendly and innocuous enough that it does not impact harvest or human consumption. Do not overfeed your garden friends; it's murder!</p>
                    <h3>Critters</h3>
                    <p>Critters are often a factor.  Rabbits, squirrels, dogs, cats, crows, and deer:  All of them can be annoying or dangerous for your garden. Deer, good luck.  Talk to your neighbors and get their advice. Deer resistant plants and 10 foot fences may be in your future. Rabbits love succulent new growth, so lettuce and peas may need protecting. Chicken wire can easily be wrapped around your garden bed, held in place by an outset screw in the wood and stake support.  Cats, dogs, and crows can all dig for different reasons.  Crows, for example,  can eat the peas after planted or probe for insects.  Typically they lose interest and are low impact to extablished gardens, but some chicken wire placed over new plantings can help.</p>
                    <h3>Planting Schedule</h3>
                    <p>Planting times are an important consideration.  Carrots and peas can be planted very early. Tomatoes and peppers cannot be exposed to frost but need as much growing time as possible.  Do some homework. Establish a plan.  Multiple plantings are normal, and an important part of having consitent fresh food.</p>

                    <h3 id="master">Experienced Gardeners</h3>
                    <p>A love of all things growing is an amazing world to be a part of!  The above recommendations may be useful. Build on your successes and keep growing.  Your experience level may warrant some changes to the garden plan we've mapped out -try new things.  Our garden philosophy is: any growth is good, gardening fosters community, and getting your hands in the dirt is its own reward.</p>
